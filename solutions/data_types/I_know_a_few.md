## Data Types? I know a few

The built-in data types:
  * dict: {'x': 1, 'y': 2}
  * list: [1, 2]
  * set: {'x', 'y'}
  * frozenset: {'x', 'y'}
  * str: 'x, y'
  * tuple: ('x', 'y')

There are also modules which are part of the standard library and provide their own data types:
  * datetime
  * collections.namedtuple
  * collections.abc
  * bisect
  ...

The list is quite long and be seen fully [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datatypes.html)
