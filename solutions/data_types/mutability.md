## Mutability

1. Explain mutability
2. Give an example of 2 data types which are mutable an 2 immutable

1. Mutability in Python refers to whether the value of certain type can be changed or not.
   For example, let's say you defined the following variable: `x = 2017`
   If you'll add 5 to it, the result is a completely different object because integers in Python are immutable: `x = 2017 + 5`

2.

Mutable:

  * List
  * Dictionary

Immutable:

  * Integer
  * String
