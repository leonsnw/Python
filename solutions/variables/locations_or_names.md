## Locations or Names

### Objective

What do you think about the following statement:

In Python, variables are locations, not just names. So `x = 1` is really the value of 1 in the memory location called x.

### Solution

The statement above is wrong. In Python a variable is merely a name, a reference to the object, not the actual object.
So when for example you perform an assignment, you don't copy the value into the variable, but you assign the object with a name.

So in case of `x = 1` what it means, is x refers to the integer 1.
