# Classes 101 - Solution

## Objectives

1. Define a class that does nothing and name it `SomeClass`
2. Create an instance of the class you defined and assign it to the variable `c`
3. True or False? In case of `c.x = 1`, `x` is a variable of value 1
4. How to retrieve the value of `x` attribute from the previous question?

## Solution

1.

```python
class SomeClass:
    pass
```

2. 

```python
c = SomeClass()
```

3. False. in `c.x`, `x` is an attribute of the instance `c` and not a variable
4. `c.x`
